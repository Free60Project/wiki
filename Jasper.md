**Jasper** is the codename of the fifth motherboard revision for the
Xbox 360. On Jasper motherboards found within Arcade SKUs, this Xbox 360
[Motherboard](Motherboard "wikilink") revision features an onboard
[memory unit](Memory_Unit "wikilink") to facilitate the
[NXE](NXE "wikilink") [Dashboard](Dashboard "wikilink").

The connections required to [dump/flash the
NAND](NAND_Reading "wikilink") are the **same** as all previous models.

Performing the [SMC Hack](SMC_Hack "wikilink") requires the same wiring
as Zephyr, Opus, and Falcon mainboards. This is a slightly different set
of connections than those required for the Xenon mainboard.
