The **Console Security Certificate** is used by the Xbox 360 as the
format of all RSA signatures generated by it. The total length of the
certificate is 552 (0x228)
bytes.

# Notes

The console type field can be very strange, especially with older
pre-1888 dashboards, for example two different 1838 keyvaults identify
their console type as 0x80000002. If you want to check if something is
devkit or retail, I'd suggest something like:

    if(consoletype == 0x02)
        return retail;
    else
        return devkit;
