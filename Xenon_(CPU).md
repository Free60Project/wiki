"KL_Microsoft_XBOX_380_CPU_ES.jpg‎") **Xenon** is the CPU that is used
in the Xbox 360. The processor, internally codenamed *Waternoose* by IBM
and XCPU by Microsoft. "The basic design is a 64-bit *PowerPC*
architecture, with the complete *PowerPC ISA available*."
It is different from the Intel Pentium III in the original Xbox: the
*Xenon* CPU is composed of three symmetrical cores on a single die, each
core has two symmetric hardware threads (SMT), for a total of six
hardware threads available to games. Each individual core also includes
32 KiB of L1 instruction cache and 32 KiB of L1 data cache.

## Specifications

  - The package is a 2-2-2 FC-PBGA, measuring 31mm by 31mm
  - 168 mm2 die size; one cpu core is about 28mm2
  - Support logic for Array and Logic Built in Selftest
  - 165 Million transistors
  - Three symmetrical cores running at 3.2 GHz each = 9.6Ghz throughput.
      - 32 KiB of L1 instruction cache and 32 KiB of L1 data cache per
        core
      - 64 bit CPU cores based on the IBM 970 "G5" design
      - Each core is two way SMT-capable and clocked at 3.2Ghz
      - 2× (128×128 bit) register files for each core
      - Two hardware threads per core; six hardware threads total
      - VMX-128 vector unit per core; three total
      - 128 VMX-128 registers per hardware thread
  - 1 MB L2 cache
      - (lockable by the GPU) running at half-speed (1.6 GHz) with a
        256-bit bus
      - 51.2 gigabytes per second of L2 memory bandwidth (256 bit × 1600
        MHz)
  - 21.6 GB/s front side bus (aggregated 10.8 GB/s upstream and
    downstream)
  - 115 GFLOPS theoretical peak performance
  - CPU Integer Perf (VPR): 1089 (363 each)
  - Dot product performance: 9.6 billion per second
  - IBM eFuse technology
  - IBM's PowerPC instruction set architecture
  - Restricted to In-order code execution
  - Big endian architecture

## Linux Support

  - We have full SMP support, so we can use all three cores.
  - However, we currently need to disable the secondary threads because
    of a yet-to-be analyzed stability issue.
  - The CPU is quite slow on general purpose code. Due to the non
    out-of-order execution core, it heavily relies on the compiler to do
    proper optimizations. GCC currently doesn't know how to do this,
    resulting in running but very inefficient code.
  - The Cell people worked on PPU-GCC, from which the Xenon will benefit
    as well, as the PPC cores is quite similiar to the Cell's PPU. All
    PPU-GCC work have been merged on mainline GCC 4.4
