# The JTAG/SMC Hack

There is a new hack which can boot homebrew code in less than 5 seconds.
See at the end of this document for a description how the hack works.
For now, all we need to know is that this is a new way to exploit the
well-known 4532 kernel, in a way which also works on updated machines,
unless they have been updated by the summer '09 update. It also works on
all hardware types.

This document is a technical description meant for people who want to
undestand the hack. If you don't understand a word, calm down - there
probably will be future releaes, howtos etc.

Please also notice that from a functional side, the result will be the
same as the KK-hack; it's just much faster, works on more hardware and
is more reliable. So it replaces the KK-hack, not less and not more.

Technical details are available
[here](http://free60.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=free60/tools;a=blob_plain;f=imgbuild/hack.txt;hb=HEAD).

## Required Soldering

The SMC Hack requires bridging 3 points on the motherboard (for trigger
the exploit by JTAG), as well as having a way to read and write with
your Nand [Flash](Flash "wikilink")

\- The JTAG points are available for a number of consoles

**Xenon**: ![X_Jtag_free60.png‎](./images/X_Jtag_free60.png "X_Jtag_free60.png‎")

**Falcon**, **Zephyr**, **Opus** &*' Jasper*':
![ZFOJ_Jtag_free60.jpg‎](./images/ZFOJ_Jtag_free60.jpg "ZFOJ_Jtag_free60.jpg‎")

**Falcon**, **Zephyr**, **Opus** &*' Jasper*' Reverse Jtag:
![Reversejatg.jpg‎](.images/Reversejatg.jpg‎ "Reversejatg.jpg‎")

\- To read and write the Nand Flash (using SPI protocol by LPT and a
printer cable), there is a friendly tutorial at [NAND
Reading](NAND_Reading "wikilink")

There are other ways to read and write the Nand Flash that are valid
(such as infectus modchip)

  - All the diodes used in SPI and JTAG are "switching diodes" proposed
    are: BAT41, 1N4148, or 1N4153

# Technical details

To understand this new hack, let's first look at what made the KK
exploit possible: A fatal bug in the Hypervisor's Syscall Handler,
introduced in the 4532 kernel update. For more details, take a look at
<http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/461489/30/0/threaded> which
explains the problem in great detail.

The KK exploit exploited the kernel bug by modifying an unsigned shader
to do a series of so-called memory exports, an operation where the GPU
can write the results of a pixel or vertex shader into physical memory.
The shader was written to overwrite the Idle-thread context to make the
kernel jump at a certain position in memory, with some registers nder
our control. In order to control all registers, a second step was
necessary, this time by jumping into the interrupt restore handler. This
finally allows all CPU general purpose registers to be filled with
etermined values. The program counter could be restored to a syscall
instruction in the kernel, with register values prefilled so that they
would trigger the exploit.

The exploit basically allows jumping into any 32-bit address in
hypervisor space. To jump into an arbitrary location, we just used a
"mtctr, bctr"-register pair in hypervisor, which would redirect
execution low into any 64-bit address. This is important, since we need
to clear the upper 32bit (i.e.,set the MSB to disable the HRMO), since
the code we want to jump to is in unencrypted memory.

This code would usually load a second-stage loader, for example XeLL,
into memory, and start it. XeLL would then attempt to catch all cpu
threads (because just the primary thread is affected by our exploit),
and load the user code, for example from DVD.

So, the following memory areas are involved:

  - Idle Thread context, at 00130360 in physical memory

This stores the stack pointer (and some other stuff) when the idle
thread was suspended. By changing the stack pointer, and then waiting
for the kernel to switch to the idle thread, the stack pointer can be
brought into our control. Part of the context switch is also a context
restore, based on the new stack pointer.

  - Context restore, part 1, arbitrary location, KK expl. uses 80130AF0

The thread-context restore doesn't restore all registers, but let's us
control the NIP (the "next instruction" pointer). We setup NIP to point
to the interrupt context restore, which does a SP-relative load of most
registers.

  - Context restore, part 2, same base location as part 1

We just re-use the same stack pointer, because the areas where the first
context restore and the interrupt context restore load from do not
overlap. The second context restore allows us to pre-set all registers
with arbitrary 64 bit values.

  - The HV offset, at 00002080 for syscall 0x46 on 4532

Because of the HV bug, we can write this offset into unencrypted memory,
giving us the possibility to jump into any location in the hypervisor
space (i.e. with a certain "encryption prefix"). We usually write
00000350 here, which points to a "mtctr %r4; bctr" instruction pair in
hypervisor, which lets us jump to %r4.

  - Our loader code, at an arbitrary location

This code will be executed from hypervisor. It's the first of our code
which will be executed. %r4 on the syscall entry has to point to this
code.

Only the idle thread context and the HV offset have fixed addresses.
It's easily possible to merge this so that only two distinct blocks
needs to be written into memory, but it's not possible to merge this
into a single block.

Fortunately, the NAND controller allows doing DMA reads where the
payload data is split from the "ECC"-data. Each page has 512 bytes of
payload, and 16 bytes of ECC data. Thus, a single DMA read can be used
to load all required memory addresses. We chose the Payload to read the
Idle Thread Context, the Context Restores and the loader code. The ECC
data will carry the HV offset.

To do a DMA read, the following NAND registers need to be written:

ea00c01c Address for Payload ea00c020 Adresss for ECC ea00c00c address
inside NAND ea00c008 command: read DMA (07)

The System Management Controller (SMC) is a 8051 core inside the
Southbridge. It manages the power sequencing, and is always active when
the Xbox 360 has (standby or full) power applied. It controls the
frontpanel buttons, has a Realtime clock, decodes IR, controls
temperatures and fans and the DVDROM tray. It talks with the frontpanel
board to set the LEDs. When the system is running, the kernel can
communicate with the SMC, for example to query the realtime clock, open
the dvd-tray etc. This happens over a bidirectional FIFO (at ea001080 /
ea001090). See the XeLL SMC code for details.

The SMC can read the NAND, because it requires access to a special NAND
page which contains a SMC config block. This block contains calibration
information for the thermal diodes, and the thermal targets etc. The
8051 core has access to NAND registers, which are mapped into the 8051
SFRs. It uses the same protocol as the kernel uses, so it writes an
address, does a "READ" command, and then reads the data out of the
"DATA" registers.

It could also do a "READ (DMA)"-command. So by hacking the SMC, we could
make the box do the exploit, without any shader - the SMC can access the
NAND controller all the time, even when the kernel is running (though it
will likely interfere with the kernel). So, we just trigger the DMA read
when the kernel has been loaded, and everything is fine.

Right?

Well, that would be too easy. While most NAND registers are mapped, the
DMA address registers (1c, 20) are not. We can DMA, but only to the
default address of zero (or wherever the kernel last DMAed into). Fail.

The GPU, the (H)ANA (the "scaler" - which in fact doesn't scale at all,
it's "just" a set of DACs, and, since Zephyr, a DVI/HDMI encoder), the
Southbridge and the CPU have their JTAG ports exposed on the board. They
are unpopulated headers, but the signals are there. CPU JTAG is a
different (complex) story, and SB JTAG doesn't offset much
funcationality. ANA JTAG is boring since the ANA doesn't sit on any
interesting bus. That leaves GPU JTAG.

GPU JTAG was reverse-engineered until a point where arbitrary PCI writes
are possible, up to a certain point. So that makes it possible to talk
to each PCI device in the system, including the NAND controller. So we
can simply use THAT instead of the SMC to start the DMA?

Right?

Well, not quite. The problem is that the "VM code", the code which does
a lot of system initialization, like the memory (that code is also
responsible for generating the 01xx "RROD"-Errors), sets a certain bit
in some GPU register, which disables the JTAG interface. The VM code is
executed way before the kernel is active. So this is fail, too.

But the combination works - by programming the DMA target address via
JTAG, and launching the attack via SMC. The attack can be launched as
soon as the kernel is running, and quite early, it does query the SMC
for the RTC. We abuse this call to start the attack instead, which is a
perfect point for us.

But how do we run an exploitable kernel at all? Most machines are
updated already. Let me refresh your knowledge about the boot process
again:

### 1BL (Bootrom)

Buried deep inside the CPU die, this ~32kb of ROM code is responsible
for reading the 2BL from NAND-flash and decrypts it into the embedded
SRAM in the CPU. It verifies the hash of the decrypted image with a
signed block at the beginning of the 2BL, and will stop execution if
this hash mismatches. This code also contains a number of test
functions, which can be activated by pulling the 5 "POST IN"-pins, which
are available on the backside of the PCB. None of these tests looks
particulary interesting (from an exploitation perspective) - they mostly
seem to be related to the FSB (the bus between CPU and GPU). This code
is fixed, and all systems use identical code here.

### 2BL ("CB")

This code is usually located at 0x8000 in NAND flash. It's decrypted by
1BL, and runs from internal SRAM.

It does a basic hardware initialization, and contains the "fuse check
code", which verifies the "2BL version". The fuses store the expected
version. The 2BL stores a "Version" and a "AllowedMask" (=bitfield), and
this is usually stored at address 0x3B1 /
0x3B2..0x3B3.

|   |      | Xenon            | Zephyr | Falcon         | Jasper |                     |
| - | ---- | ---------------- | ------ | -------------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| 2 | 0003 | 1888, 1901, 1902 |        |                |        |                     |
| 4 |      | 1920             |        |                |        | "new zeropair code" |
| 5 | 0010 | 1921             | 4558   | 5760,5761,5770 | 6712   | TA-fixed            |

It then verifies the pairing information stored in the 2BL header. Part
of this verification is a checksum check of the NAND area which was used
to load the SMC code from.

It also contains a virtual machine and some code to run on this machine.
The virtual machine code, which is pretty complicated, does the
following things:

  - Initialisation of the PCI-Bridge
  - Disable the GPU PCIE JTAG test port
  - initialize the serial port
  - talk to the SMC to clear the "handshake"-bit
  - initialize memory
  - hopefully not: generate RROD if memory init fails

After that, the external (512MB) memory will be initialized and usable.
2BL then decrypts the 4BL into this memory. Memory encryption will
already be enabled - no executable code is \*ever\* written unencrypted.

### 4BL ("CD")

This code is responsible for checking and unpacking 5BL, as well as
applying update patches. First, the fuses are read to determine the
console "Update Sequence", a number which basically counts the number of
updates installed. Since updates are, in the same way as 2BL, paired to
a console, this allows to configure the console in a way that no old
update will be used. So each update slot stores the maximum value of
burned fuses (well, essentially the exact value). The base kernel also
has an associated value, usually zero, but this can be changed in the
2BL pairing data block. This is what the timing-attack increments, in
order to revert to the 1888 kernel.

### 5BL ("HV/Kernel")

The HV and kernel are merged into a single image, which is compressed
with a proprietary algorithm (LDIC).

### 6BL ("CF"), 7BL ("CG")

This is part of a system upgrade. Each console has a so-called "Base
Kernel", which is the 1888 kernel which was available on launch back in
2005. Then there are two "update slots" - areas of 64k each (128k on
Jasper), which contain a 6BL and 7BL. 6BL is code which applies the
update, using a clever delta-compression. 7BL is the actual
delta-compressed update, essentially a binary diff.

Oh, updates are \>64k. So only the first 64k are actually stored in the
update slots, the rest is stored in the filesystem as a special file.
Since 6BL doesn't contain a filesystem parser, a blockmap is added in
6BL which points to the sectors which contain the rest of the update.

### Zero-Pairing

Now there is a special situation: If the 2BL pairing block is all-zero,
the pairing block will not be checked. However, a bit is set so that the
kernel doesn't boot the dashboard binary, but a special binary called
"MfgBootLauncher", where "Mfg" probably stands for "Manufacturing". So
this is a leftover of the production process, where the flash image is
used on all hardware, probably also before any CPU-key has been
programmed.

By abusing this feature, this allows us easily to produce a flash image
which runs on all hardware. However, 4BL won't look at update slots when
it detects this mode, so we end up in the 1888 base kernel. And we can't
run the dashboard, so it's impossible to escape this mode.

Previously, this has been deemed very uninteresting, because first the
1888 isn't exploitable by the KK exploit, and second because it's
impossible to run the KK game anyway.

However, starting with 2BL version 1920, an interesting thing happened:
The encryption key for 4BL is generated with the help of the CPU-key
now. That means that without the CPU-key, it's not possible to decrypt
the 4BL anymore. Note that each 2BL has exactly a single valid 4BL
binary - 2BL contains a hardcoded hash for the 4BL, and doesn't use RSA.

However, zero'ed pairing data is detected, the CPU-key is NOT used in
this process, like it was previously. That also means that you cannot
just zero-out the pairing data anymore - the 4BL would be decrypted with
the wrong key then. Instead you need to decrypt the 4BL (which requires
knowing the CPU key), and re-encrypt it with the old algorithm.

However, 1920 was suspectible to the timing attack - so a CPU-key
recovery was possible on one console, which allowed us to decrypt the
1920 4BL. That 4BL shows a very intersting change: Whenever zero-pairing
is detected, the update slots are not ignored anymore. Instead, if the
update-slots are zero-paired as well, they are applied.

This change allows us to boot any kernel, provided we have a (1920 and
up) 2BL/4BL set which runs on that machine. This is very important,
because we can build up an image now which runs into the 4532 kernel,
regardless on how many update fuses are set. However, the 2BL revocation
process must be passed, so we are not completely independent of the
fuses, still. But since we use zero-pairing, the SMC hash doesn't matter
anymore (there are other ways to work around the SMC hash problem, like
the TA, but we get this for free). Still, we boot into the
MfgBootLauncher (into the 4532 version now, which does a red/green
blinking thingie - you'll notice once you see it, it's very unique and
doesn't look like any RROD or so). But thanks to the SMC/JTAG hack
described above, this allows us to launch our attack from this state.

Newer consoles (which have the TA fix) don't run 1920 anymore. They run,
for example, 1921. The problem is that we cannot run HV code on these
machines, so we don't know the CPU key. However, when comparing the 1921
and 1920 2BL (which we can still decrypt), the only change is the
addition of the timing attack fix (i.e. replacing two memcmp instances
with a memdiff function). Also, we know the expected hash value of the
decrypted 4BL. Based on a 1920 4BL, and the guess what has changed
functionally, and the new size of the 4BL, we were able to guess the
modifications, which yields an image which passes the 2BL hash check.
Note that this is not a hash collision - we did merely derive the exact
image by applying the changes between 1920 2BL and 1921 2BL into 1920
4BL, yielding the 1921 4BL.

The 1921 2BL theoretically runs on all machines so far, even TA-proof
ones. But it crashes on Zephyr, Falcon and Jasper. The reason is the VM
code, which doesn't cover the different GPUs (Xenon has 90nm GPU, Zephyr
and Falcon have 80nm, Jasper has 60nm, so there are 3 GPU revisions in
total).

But the step from 1921 to, say, 4558, is even smaller. It's just the
different version number, plus a slight difference in the memcpy code,
which again can be ported over from 2BL.

Jasper's 67xx is a different thing, since this code adds support for the
largeblock flash used in "Arcade"-Jasper units. We have used some magic
to retrieve this code.

So we now have ALL 4BL versions. Isn't that great? It means that ALL
machines can run the 4532 kernel. The good news is also that the 4532
kernel supports falcon consoles, and runs long enough to also work on
jasper consoles (because we exploit way before the different GPU is
touched at all).

## Troubleshooting

### Q: "The power supply goes red when plugging in power\!"

A: You shorted a power pin, probably V33_SB, the one attached to the
NAND flash. Carefully look for solder residues. Use a lot of flux and a
properly-heated soldering
iron.

### Q: "The power supply stays yellow when I press the power button, and nothing else happens."

A: The SMC code is invalid. This can be a misconnected flashrom, an
illegal image, a bad flash or simply a bad SMC code. Verify:

  - Electrical connections first.
  - Did you flash with the proper ECC settings? The flash images we are
    working with usually contain raw ECC information, i.e. 512+16 bytes
    per sector. Make sure your flash programmer is not modifying these
    16 bytes, but writing those as they are.
  - Have you used the right SMC image?

### Q: "The fans run at full speed immediately."

A: This is very likely a bad SMC config sector. Did you flash all the
parts generated by the image creation tool at the proper position? Note
that offsets are given as payload offsets, not counting ECC bytes.
Usually this matches what your average NAND programmer tells you, but in
case you re-assembled these into a single image, take care to properly
convert the offsets.

### Q: "I get E79"

A: This means that, congratulations, your console is still booting into
a kernel, and just cannot go further (which was to be exepcted, given
that there is no filesystem anymore). You're almost there, but for some
reasons, the DMA attack didn't run. This can be either that you didn't
used a patched SMC, or that the target address wasn't inserted properly.

### Q: "Console powers on, but I get a black screen."

A: Well, there are many reasons here again. First, wait some time (~1
minute), and see if you get a RROD. If you do, the VM code failed to
handshake with the SMC (error code XXXX), which usually means that it
crashed, and the SMC watchdog triggered until it retried too often. Did
you use the proper 2BL/4BL image for your machine type? Did you use a
recent enough SMC version? Since the VM code took more and more time
(from roughly a half second in 1888 to several seconds in 1920), the SMC
code was modified to time out later. Be sure to use a known-good SMC
version, if possible, based on the version which was installed before.
If you don't get a RROD, please try checking your POST code. You can do
this via CPU jtag, or by measuring the 8 POST pins.

Post code 6C:

  - The exploit failed, somehow.

Post code 10:

  - Our code is running\! That's great, but it failed copying the
    XeLL-payload from flash. Try booting into the alternate loader (see
    below in the "exploit loader" section), or reflash.

Post code 11:

  - Exploit code ran, and jumped into XeLL. XeLL crashed. Try alternate
    loader, or do serial upload for recovery, if you really screwed up
    both the primary and secondary loader. (You failed, in that case.)

Post codes \>= 0x80:

  - Those are errors from the bootloader. Please check the disassembly
    of those loaders to see what's wrong exactly. It shouldn't happen
    unless you have a bad flash.

Post code 0xA0:

  - Your 2BL didn't want to run on your hardware due to the 2BL
    revocation fuses. Use a more recent 2BL/4BL set for your hardware.
    If you're already running {1921, 4558, 5770, 6712} then you're out
    of luck. Your box was already updated to a newer 2BL, which likely
    fixed what we used to exploit. Restore R6T3, restore the flash
    image, and use this console for playing games. Get another console,
    and try again.

Please note that some hardware elements are not properly initialized at
the early time of the exploit. This affects:

CPU:

  - The CPU is initialized in low-power mode, where it runs at
    quarter-speed.

Setting the CPU power mode is possible, of course, but needs to be
reverse-engineered from the corresponding hypervisor syscall.

GPU:

  - A full screen setup is required, including the programming of the
    ANA-chip. Code is available for setting up a 640x480 VGA mode,
    support for other resolutions needs to be added.
  - EDRAM must be "trained". This is what fails when the E-74 error is
    displayed. The code is rather complex, and has been
    reverse-enginnered, but doesn't run properly yet. However, it has
    been shown to work a bit, and can likely be tweaked to work
    properly.

SATA:

  - SATA likely needs some reset sequence. Linux kernel does this fine,
    but XeLL doesn't work.

All of these issues are expected to be fixed.

This hack can also be used to reboot into a Microsoft kernel, in order
to keep the possibility of playing games locally. This is not within the
scope of this document, and is actually not related to this hack at all.
This hack allows you the execution of software - and YOU decide what
software that should be. It could be linux, your favourite emulator, or
a rebooter.

Note that we do not support patching the Microsoft kernel for piracy
under any circumstances. Also, playing on LIVE with a modified console
won't be possible without getting banned, ever. There are already
challenges in place which detect any unauthorized modification. We urge
you to not abuse this hack for piracy.

## EXPLOIT LOADER

The first own code which is executed is a small loader, which operates
in the following way:

  - If a character is present on the serial port, it will be read.
      - if that character is '@', we will enter serial upload mode.
      - if that character is ' ', we will use the backup bootloader
  - if not serial upload mode:
      - POST 0x10
      - read bootloader from flash (either backup or normal)
      - POST 0x11
      - run
  - serial upload mode:
      - output '\>'
      - receive characters
      - after 10 consecutive 'x', stop upload
      - output '\!'
      - run

This allows some kind of recovery if you want to update the in-flash
bootloader.

The used addresses are the following:

  - FLASH_BASE is the location in flash of the backup bootloader,
  - FLASH_BASE + 0x40000 is the location of the main bootloader,
  - CODE_BASE is the memory address of the bootloader in ram.

By default, the following memory map is used:

00000000..00100000: SMC, KV, CB, CD, CE, CF, CG, backup bootloader
00100000..00140000: main bootloader
00140000..00f7c000: empty space
00f7c000 : smc config block
00ffc000 : exploit buffer

But this can be tweaked.
