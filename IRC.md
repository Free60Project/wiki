Join us on the Free60 IRC channel at <irc://irc.oftc.net/free60-chat>
(server irc.oftc.net, channel **\#free60-chat**)

To contribute new information and speak with devs, come to
<irc://irc.oftc.net/free60> (server irc.oftc.net, channel **\#free60**)

There's also a channel for the guys on EFNET which is currently the most
active channel of all three.

Catch us in **\#libxenon** on EFnet\!

Free60 and oftc.net are happy to facilitate the means for information
gathering and dissemination. But, we have some basic guidelines we need
you to follow.

## Guidelines

We're not trying to be dictators, we just want everyone to get along.
[OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/) is a civil network and we'd like to keep it
that way.

### Basic Guidelines

  - Be polite. Flaming others and the like is considered bad netiquette,
    and is frowned upon. This will more than likely result in you and
    any participating parties being banned from the channel.

  - Be on-topic. Off-topic discussion is considered noise and should be
    directed elsewhere.

  - Do not /msg people with on-topic discussion. Rather, discuss that
    in-channel.

  - Do not overly repeat yourself. We heard you the first time.

  - Please don't run any bots without prior permission from an op.

  - Channel opertator status is not a privilege, but rather a
    responsibilty. Asking for such will more than likely get you banned.

  - \#free60 is NOT a distribution point for pirated/illegal material,
    be it software or even documentation. We have zero-tolerance towards
    any related discussion. That also goes for use of√Ç \!list or other
    such commands. You have been warned.

### Asking Questions

#### Before Asking

  - Search the wiki for an answer.
  - Search the mailing list.

#### While Asking

  - Be polite.
  - Be patient.
  - Be pertinent -- that is make sure your question has something to do
    with the channel you're in.

#### After Asking

  - If your question was answered and can't be found on the wiki please
    post that info.
  - Stick around to help others after you.

### Use the right channel

There are two channels in OFTC currently for public use:

1.  \#free60 is for technical and development discussion, for idle chat
    seek \#free60-chat.
2.  \#free60-chat is for general discussion on or off topic for free60
    and is loosely controlled.

And one public channel on EFNET

1.  \#libxenon for everything from LibXenon and Linux till XeLL

  - Currently neither channel is moderated ( m) though if conversations
    get out of hand or anything of that nature we reserve the right to
    place higher restrictions.
  - Both channels will receive the same updates about important
    information.
  - You can hang out in both, but make sure you questions are for the
    right channel.

## Conclusion

Thank you for your interest in Free60, enjoy your stay\!
