**FATX** is the file system used by the Xbox and the Xbox 360, it is
unsupported natively by Windows but has some functionality in Linux.
Sometimes called "XTAF" (due to its little endian header), the file
system is derived from the age-old [MS-DOS file
system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table) and can be
considered as a cleaned-up version of it.

Note that, while not part of the file system itself, the media which
contain this file system do not have a master file table which describes
which file system starts where. It is up to the consumer (Xbox 360,
[geom_xbox360 kernel
module](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=kern/107707), ...) to
know this.

# File System Layout

The file system is divided into 4 parts:

  - Header (the BOOT sector on FAT file systems)
  - File allocation table (FAT)
  - Root directory cluster/data region

All multi-byte values contained in each part are
[\[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)\] big-endian.

## Difference Between Retail and Development Kit HDD

The essential difference between retail and devkit HDDs is that devkit
HDDs hold a partition table (length of 0x18 bytes) at the start of the
drive. The table contains sector and length information for the Content
and DEVKIT Partitions (possibly Compatibility partition too). This
partition table only exists on Devkit HDDs, retails have the offsets
built in to the kernel.

## USB Drive Layout

Unlike the hard disks and memory units that the Xbox 360 originally
shipped with, the USB drives which can be Xbox 360-configured contain
sets of files located in a hidden "Xbox360" folder located in the root
of the device. The Data0000-Data0003 files are **always** present no
matter what the device size. The Data0000 file houses the Cache/USB
System Extended partitions, device performance information, and device
geometry (mainly just the total device size). Data0001 contains the file
allocation table for the Data partition, which uses the remaining files.

There was some research done in hopes to remove the maximum device size
of 16 GB (for Xbox 360 storage) on exploited/development consoles, but
it was later discovered that anything a few GB larger than the current
maximum causes the console to crash.

### <span class="mw-headline"> Configuration file </span>

The configuration is the first 2 sectors (0x400 bytes) of the Data0000
and is created when the device is configured. It contains info about the
device and is secured with a signature. The layout is as follows:

**Type 1 (Certificate size = 0x228)**

| Offset | Length     | Description                          |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 0      | 0x1A8      | \[\[Console_Security_Certificate   |
| 0x1A8  | 0x80       | Signature (part of the console cert) |
| 0x228  | 0x14       | Device ID                            |
| 0x23C  | 4 (UINT32) | Certificate size (0x228)             |
| 0x240  | 8 (UINT64) | Size of device in bytes              |
| 0x248  | 2 (UINT16) | Read speed in KBs                    |
| 0x24A  | 2 (UINT16) | Write speed in KBs                   |
| 0x24C  | 0x1B4      | Padding (0x00)                       |

**Type 2 (Certificate size = 0x100)**

| Offset | Length     | Description              |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| 0      | 0x100      | Device Signature         |
| 0x100  | 0xA8       | Padding (0x00)           |
| 0x228  | 0x14       | Device ID                |
| 0x23C  | 4 (UINT32) | Certificate size (0x100) |
| 0x240  | 8 (UINT64) | Size of device in bytes  |
| 0x248  | 2 (UINT16) | Read speed in KBs        |
| 0x24A  | 2 (UINT16) | Write speed in KBs       |
| 0x24C  | 0x1B4      | Padding (0x00)           |

The signature is derived from a SHA1 hash taken from the start of the
device id (0x228) till the end of the config (0x1D8 bytes) and is signed
with the consoles private key and the matching public parameters are
present in the console certificate for verification later on.

The certificate size is used to determine how to verify the
configuration file when the device is mounted. If the value is 0x228
then the device was configured by an Xbox and the signature is verified
using the params in the console certificate, if the value is 0x100 then
the device was pre-configured by Microsoft and is verified using the
SATA public key (also used for HDDSS verification).

The last 2 values are written when the device is configured, it is
unknown how these are used later on. Perhaps it could be used to
determine what connected device would provide best performance for
caching.

## Partition Header

For each offset, add the offset of the partition.

| Offset | Length | Type         | Information            |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| 0x0    | 0x4    | ascii string | Partition magic (XTAF) |
| 0x4    | 0x4    | unsigned int | Partition ID           |
| 0x8    | 0x4    | unsigned int | Sectors per Cluster    |
| 0xC    | 0x4    | unsigned int | Root directory cluster |

## SysExt Partition

The SystemUpdate with Kernel-Version 2.0.12611.0 (Kinect-Dashboard)
introduced a new system to hold the Kinect-/Avatar related systemfiles.
It creates a Partition named "SysExt" aka SystemExtended to store these
files. You could call it a Sub-Partition or Hidden-Partition as it's a
"Partition inside another Partition".

## "Josh" Sector

The **"Josh" Sector** is located on the 4th sector (0x800). It's purpose
is currently unknown. It may be used just to identify the Xbox that
previously formatted it.

| 0x280  | 0x4    | unsigned int         | TitleID(for the second VolumeDescriptor) |

The upper 4 bits in the STFSVolumeDescriptor.Flags seem to always be set
(maybe to signify it is cache)

## Security Sector

The **Security Sector** is used by Microsoft to verify that the
harddrive is an original Microsoft product. The **Security Sector**
holds details such as drive sector count, drive serial number and the
Microsoft logo (to stop other companies using it)

It begins at the 16th sector on the drive
(0x2000).

| Offset | Length       | Type                         | Information                |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |

| 0x14   | 0x8          | ascii string                 | Firmware Revision          |
| 0x1C   | 0x28         | ascii string                 | Model Number               |
| 0x44   | 0x14         | bytes                        | MS Logo Hash               |
| 0x58   | 0x4          | unsigned int (LITTLE ENDIAN) | Number of Sectors on drive |
| 0x5C   | 0x100        | bytes                        | RSA Signature              |
| 0x200  | 0x4          | signed int                   | MS Logo Size               |
| 0x204  | MS Logo Size | image                        | MS Logo                    |

If a **Security Sector** from a smaller hard drive is used on a bigger
one, the Xbox will only see the number of sectors defined in the
**Security Sector**.

# Chainmap and directories

To find the offset of the chainmap, take the offset of the position and
add 4096 (0x1000) to it. Each entry in the chainmap is either an
unsigned int or a unsigned short, depending on the number of clusters
inside the partition.

To work out the cluster size, take the Sectors per Cluster value and
multiply it by 512 (0x200).

To work out the number of clusters, divide the partitions size by the
cluster size and that's have the number of clusters.

If the number of clusters is below 65520 (0xFFF0), then the drive uses
2-byte chainmap entries, otherwise it uses 4-byte chainmap entries. The
size of the chainmap is the size of the chainmap entries multiplied by
the partitions cluster count.

To get a clusters offset, you need to work out the offset of the file
data area. This is determined by taking the chainmap offset and adding
it's size to it. You then simply times the cluster index (minus 1) by
the cluster size and add it to the file data offset.

To get a clusters chainmap entrys offset, times the cluster index by the
chain map entry size and add that to the chainmap offset.

### Files

The file contents is stored per cluster as indicated by the chainmap and
the starting cluster (see below). If the file is larger than one
cluster, it is stored in multiple clusters. If the length of the file is
not a multiple of the cluster size, then the last cluster is only
partially used. **If the file covers more than 1 cluster, the next
cluster must be determined by finding the current cluster's entry in the
chainmap and using the value as the next cluster.**

### Directories

Directories are stored in a tabular format. Because directories are
normal files with the "directory" bit set, they are allocated in the FAT
and may therefore cover multiple clusters. This makes it possible to
have many files in one directory.

Each entry of the directory table is 64 bytes long.

An entry can be set to all 0xFF bytes, which means that this entry is
unused and probably marks the end of the directory contents. Used
entries are filled as
follows:

| Offset | Type               | Size | Description                                      |
| ------ | ------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 0x00   | byte               | 1    | File name length, or 0xE5 for deleted files      |
| 0x01   | byte               | 1    | File Attributes                                  |
| 0x02   | ASCII string       | 0x2A | file name, padded with either 0x00 or 0xFF bytes |
| 0x2C   | unsigned int       | 4    | First cluster of file, null/0x00 for empty files |
| 0x30   | (un?)signed int    | 4    | File size                                        |
| 0x34   | (un?)signed short? | 2    | Creation date                                    |
| 0x36   | (un?)signed short? | 2    | Creation time                                    |
| 0x38   | (un?)signed short? | 2    | Last write date                                  |
| 0x3A   | (un?)signed short? | 2    | Last write time                                  |
| 0x3C   | (un?)signed short  | 2    | Last access time                                 |
| 0x3E   | (un?)signed short  | 2    | Last access time                                 |

The file flags and the date and time fields are in the same format as
the one used in the FAT file system. For time, bits 15-11 represent the
hour, 10-5 the minutes, 4-0 the seconds. For date, bits 15-9 are the
year, 8-5 are the month, 4-0 are the day.

The volume bit is unused, the volume label is instead stored in a file
"name.txt" in the root directory. The contents of this file is
big-endian UTF-16 (Unicode string) starting at offset 0x2

The following characters are found in XTAF file names from actual disk
images:

  - 0x20, 0x24, 0x2e ( SPACE $ . )
  - 0x30-0x39 (digits 0-9)
  - 0x41-0x5a (letters A-Z)
  - 0x5f ( _ )
  - 0x61-0x7a (letters a-z)

Unlike the FAT file system, XTAF has no "." and ".." entries in the
directory tables. This means that it's only possible to go to the parent
directory by remembering its cluster
number.
