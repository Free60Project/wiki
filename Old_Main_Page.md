**Free60** is a project towards porting GNU/Linux, BSD, Darwin and related open-source operating systems to the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game console.
	- 3-core **PowerPC**, **3.2** GHz
	- **512 MB** of RAM
	- **ATI** graphics
	- (optional) **20 GB** hard drive
	- **DVD** drive
	- 3x **USB** 2.0
	- 100 MBit **Ethernet**
	- **TV/VGA** support
## Status
### Run Code
You can run your own code on Xbox 360 systems with kernel versions 4532 and 4548. If you own a box manufactured before 2007, upgrade to one of these versions, but to no later one.

### Linux Bootloader
A preliminary second-stage boot loader exists.

### Linux Kernel
Patches for the Linux kernel to support a large part of the Xbox 360 hardware exist. As long as you're waiting for a convenient way to boot, you can set up your cross compiler environment.

#### Linux Distributions
Several [LiveCD](LiveCD.md) variants and installation howtos for [Debian-etch](Debian-etch.md), [Ubuntu7.04](Ubuntu7.04) and [Ubuntu7.10](Ubuntu7.10) are available.

29 Sep 2007: 3D Acceleration work has started: tmbinc has released an initial version of his ['gpu' library](https://web.archive.org/web/20130224191548/http://debugmo.de/2007/09/fear-triangles/). It does not yet follow a standard API (like OpenGL), but allows you to play with the 3D GPU.

8 May 2007: Updated LiveCD ready: Stonersmurf mastered the updated [LiveCD](LiveCD.md) including the latest kernel patches. The [Download](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/free60/gentoo-livecd-xenon-beta-v2.iso) is 621MB in size. See the [Release Notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=139616&amp;release_id=506402) for details. Here is the [Press Release](Press_Release_2007-05-08)

**1 May 2007: We now have a fix for Samsung users** We will soon release an updated [LiveCD](LiveCD.md). If you want to build your own kernel, see [Linux Kernel Development](Linux_Kernel_Development.md) for patches against linux-2.6.21.

**1 Apr 2007: X.org driver and a new LiveCD** No April Fools' Day joke. We have released a preliminary [X.org driver](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=139616&amp;package_id=227107) and Cpasjuste has built a new [LiveCD](LiveCD.md) which makes use of it. Unfortunately, support for Samsung drives and sound drivers are still missing.

**30 Mar 2007: Gentoo Minimal LiveCD** Cpasjuste has combined the Kernel patches and latest Xell into a LiveCD. The [download](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=139616) is about 90MB in size and since it uses the *readcd* boot method, you may soon be able to boot it without soldering a serial connection to your Xbox 360 mainboard.

**20 Mar 2007: Linux Bootloader available** tmbinc has come up with a [Linux Bootloader](Linux_Bootlader.md), which handles CPU initialization and loads the [Linux Kernel](Linux_Kernel.md) either from network or CDROM.

**8 Mar 2007: First Linux patchset available** Felix Domke posted a patchset for the [Linux Kernel 2.6.20 Kernel](Linux_Kernel.md) to the Linux-PPC mailing list.

**1 Mar 2007: Hypervisor privilege-escalation vulnerability** Some "Anonymous Hacker"; published a [security advisory](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/461489) that will make it possible to run alternative operating systems on the Xbox 360.

**30 Dec 2006: Homebrew mock-up at 23C3** An "Anonymous Hacker" showed a Xbox 360 running unsigned code at 23C3 conference. See more in the [Videos](Videos.md) section.

**7 Mar 2006: CPU Datasheet** More great work from [Speedy22] this time he has created a datasheet for the Xbox 360's [CPU](CPU.md). It can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20061022203457/http://www.dave-bell.co.uk/~speedy22/XBOX360cpu15data.pdf).
