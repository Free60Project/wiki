  - Whats the status of the project?
    We can run unsigned code, [Linux](Linux_Kernel "wikilink") patches
    exist and a [second level boot loader](XeLL "wikilink") as well as
    several [LiveCDs](LiveCD "wikilink") have been released. But you
    still need a first-level boot loader. There are two in the wild, by
    Crawler360 and xorloser. Both require you to patch the shaders of
    the Xbox 360 title King Kong. The xorloser loader is probably what
    you are looking for as it works without soldering a serial cable to
    the motherboard of your Xbox 360.

  - Is it possible to run unsigned code on the Xbox 360?
    Yes. Look at [Run Code](Run_Code "wikilink").

  - Which hack should I use for my xbox kernel version?

    Kernel lower than 2.0.4548: See [Timing
    Attack](Timing_Attack "wikilink")

    Kernel up to 2.0.7371: There's a method to run unsigned code if your
    Dashboard-Version is not higher than 7371. Have a look at [SMC
    Hack](SMC_Hack "wikilink")

    Kernel higher than 7371: The new [Reset Glitch
    Hack](Reset_Glitch_Hack "wikilink") supports many consoles with
    recent Kernels

    Relevant news items are posted on the [front
    page](Main_Page "wikilink"). For what else has changed on the Wiki,
    see the [recent changes](Special:RecentChanges "wikilink").

  - Will I void my warranty by taking my machine apart?
    Yes. There is a tamper-proof seal that must be broken to get any
    further than just removing the faceplate. Doing so automatically
    voids any warranty you might have had.

  - How can I subscribe to the free60.org mailinglist?
    Sorry, Mailing Lists aren't available anymore.

  - I have access to official documentation or official developer
    software/hardware. May I help?
    No. Contributing any such information would put you in violation of
    your Non-Disclosure Agreement, while tainting the project at the
    same time. Note, however, IANAL and TINLA.
