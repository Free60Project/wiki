**Trinity** is the codename of the motherboard used in the Xbox 360
Slim. It is the sixth motherboard revision. It was originally believed
that it's codename was **Valhalla**, but after looking through debug
files it was found that this is not the case. It no longer has Memory
Unit ports. It has a special port for connecting the
Kinect peripheral, which provides power to the
device instead of plugging it in separately. It also features a single
chip that contains the CPU, GPU and eDRAM, with a 45nm die size. The
Xbox 360 Slim, and as a result, the motherboard are much smaller than
the original. It also contains an internal USB port which has a 802.11n
WiFi card inserted. The HDD port was also changed, making it much
smaller and flush against the case. The RRoD is also non-existant,
replaced with a single red power light on any errors.
