# Memory

## System Memory - Mainboard & GPU

- 512 MB of Unified GDDR3 RAM
    - Unified Memory Architecture
    - Reduces cost and complexity of the motherboard design
- 700 MHz DDR
    - Effective transmission rate of 1.4 GHz on the 128-bit bus
- Unified Memory Architecture (GPU & CPU Access)
    - GPU 10MB eDRAM
- 128-bit interface to ATI's memory controller

## Memory Bandwidth

- 32 GB/s GPU to eDRAM bandwidth
    - 2 GHz @ 2 accesses per clock cycle on a 64 bit DDR bus
- 22.4 GB/s memory interface bus bandwidth (low latency path to CPU
  cores)
    - 700 MHz @ 2 accesses per clock cycle (one per edge) on a 128 bit
      bus
- 256 GB/s memory bandwidth to eDRAM
- 21.6 GB/s front-side bus
- [Southbridge](./Southbridge.md) bandwidth of 500 MB/s.
