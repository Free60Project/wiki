# USB

•The Xbox 360 comes with 3 standard USB 2.0 ports. (2 on the front and 1
on the back)

The Xbox 360 added official support for using USB drives as a mean of
storing Xbox 360 files on April 6, 2010. Files are stored to the flash
drive by using files within a hidden folder (Root\\Xbox360\\) that are
mounted with the [FATX](FATX) file system.

## Confirmed Facts

Can be used to add hard disk and get around DRM.

## Speculation

  - iPod and standard USB flashdrives using the FAT(32)? Filesystem are
    detected via the 360 media center.(Cannot read NTFS)
  - The Xbox 360 seems to be able to read the HFS filesystem Mac
    formatted iPods.
  - It is unknown if the USB ports can access DMA but it is speculated
    that the USB ports may be read-only. Such speculation is
    questionable, as two-way communication is required to be able to
    communicate with products. Instead, any read-only access control may
    be implemented in the Dashboard, or write support may simply not
    exist within the filesystem drivers. - This is most likely
    impossible - There are no "slave initiated DMA" transactions as part
    of the USB spec. Even if it does support USB OTG, and therefore can
    act as a Slave, a driver \[on the xbox\] would still need to be
    present for any usb endpoints to exist.
