# Jasper

**Jasper** is the codename of the fifth motherboard revision for the
Xbox 360. On Jasper motherboards found within Arcade SKUs, this Xbox 360
[Motherboard](../Motherboard) revision features an onboard
[memory unit](../Memory_Unit) to facilitate the
[NXE](../NXE) [Dashboard](../Dashboard).

The connections required to [dump/flash the NAND](../NAND_Reading)
are the **same** as all previous models.

Performing the [SMC Hack](../SMC_Hack) requires the same wiring
as Zephyr, Opus, and Falcon mainboards. This is a slightly different set
of connections than those required for the Xenon mainboard.
