### General Info

### NFO

    As a testbed, ive ported SDLQuake in parallel with libSDLXenon

    SDLQuake libXenon repository is located at

    https://github.com/lantus/sdlquake-libxenon

    Download the source and use 'make' to build SDLQuake.

    I've attached a binary with shareware quake as well.

    Enjoy :)
