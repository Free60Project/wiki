# Hypervisor (old notes)

no booting details known changes between beta hardware and final: alpha
hardware = macintosh beta = ? looks like retail, but no encryption
second beta =\! retail

tried to dump RAM could only dump virtual memory ram is at 8000_0000
southbridge: pci config space, mapped to VM, accessible by user apps
memory at bottom looks random/encrypted, might be hypervisor 256 KB

8040_0000 xbox kernel starts, MZ header

read memory using debug interface: everything is in plaintext, you can
read kernel + app (dashboard etc.), i.e. virtual memory is not encrypted

kernel interesting to disassemble communication with hypervisor using
syscalls

hypervisor does interrupts/exceptions

### SC 22 (Burn fuses)

tested on 2 kernels

first: SC "access fuses"

second: "burn fuses"

(rumour has it that this is used to make retail boxes out of debug
boxes)

memory management 0F/10: perhaps page table access code in hypervisor, 
all high level code in kernel

you can't map memory as you like

network adapter in the southbridge

debug code dumps registers with names

it is possible to dump physical memory using network adapter DMA
accesses

not perfect dump

reading physical memory = encrypted

data segments are not encrypted, but nearly all code segments

older recovery cd (early 2005), worked on first beta developer kits, 
without security enabled:

cd included kernel which included stuff that is encrypted in retail
version

includes hypervisor code\! it is old, but...

getspr: SC 6

setspr: SC 7 -\> possible to see implementation of basic syscall
handling

function in hypervisor to chain-run a new kernel from the old kernel

hypervisor: sign with private key etc.

hypervisor can only do physical memory

hashing: load into register base address, length, destination of hash
buffer, call syscode, hypervisor will hash -\> attack: hash 1 byte, 
\*itself\*, -\> hangs

hypervisor lies at 0 in VM and physical mem
