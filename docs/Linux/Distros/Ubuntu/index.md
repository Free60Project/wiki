# Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a computer operating system based on the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution and is distributed as free and open source software with
additional proprietary software available.

Ubuntu is composed of many software packages, of which the vast majority
are distributed under a free software license (also known as open
source). The main license used is the GNU General Public License (GNU
GPL) which, along with the GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU LGPL),
explicitly declares that users are free to run, copy, distribute, study,
change, develop and improve the software.

Canonical, the company that endorses the Ubuntu project (as well as
Kubuntu and other Ubuntu-based derivations) releases new versions of
Ubuntu every six months and supports Ubuntu for eighteen months by
providing security fixes, patches to critical bugs and minor updates to
programs. LTS (Long Term Support) versions, which are released every two
years, are supported for three years on the desktop and five years for
servers. The latest version of Ubuntu, 10.04 (Lucid Lynx), is such an
LTS version, and was released on April 29, 2010.

It is possible to boot Ubuntu by using an Xbox 360 which has had the
[SMC Hack](../../..//Hacks/SMC_Hack.md) applied.
