## Guidelines

Free60 and Libera.Chat are happy to facilitate the means for information
gathering and dissemination. But, we have some basic guidelines we need
you to follow.

We're not trying to be dictators, we just want everyone to get along.
[Libera](https://libera.chat/) is a civil network and we'd like to keep it
that way.

### Basic Guidelines

  - Be polite. Flaming others and the like is considered bad netiquette,
    and is frowned upon. This will more than likely result in you and
    any participating parties being banned from the channel.

  - Be on-topic. Off-topic discussion is considered noise and should be
    directed elsewhere.

  - Do not /msg people with on-topic discussion. Rather, discuss that
    in-channel.

  - Do not overly repeat yourself. We heard you the first time.

  - Please don't run any bots without prior permission from an op.

  - Channel operator status is not a privilege, but rather a
    responsibilty. Asking for such will more than likely get you banned.

  - \#free60 is NOT a distribution point for pirated/illegal material,
    be it software or even documentation. We have zero-tolerance towards
    any related discussion.
  
  - Messages sent in the IRC channels are forwarded to the Discord guild.

### Asking Questions

#### Before Asking

  - Search the wiki and [GitHub](https://github.com/Free60Project) for an answer.

#### While Asking

  - Be polite.
  - Be patient.
  - Be pertinent -- that is make sure your question has something to do
    with the channel you're in.

#### After Asking

  - If your question was answered and can't be found on the wiki please
    post that info.
  - Stick around to help others after you.

## Conclusion

Thank you for your interest in Free60, enjoy your stay!
